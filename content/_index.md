### DS@GT Applied Research and Competitions

The [Data Science @ Georgia Tech (DS@GT)](https://datasciencegt.org) Applied Research Competitions (ARC) is a student-run research group focused on machine learning, information retrieval, and data-driven scientific modeling through participation in competitive research challenges.
The group organizes participation in the [Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF)](https://www.clef-initiative.eu) but also leverages platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and [PACE](https://pace.gatech.edu) for training and internal skill development.
Our code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dsgt-arc).

We recently wrapped up our Spring 2025 semester with 22 accepted working note papers and 45 authors at [CLEF 2025](https://clef2025.clef-initiative.eu).
We are preparing for the Fall 2025 Interest Group and Spring 2026 competition season.
In addition to CLEF 2026, we plan to participate in [TREC 2025](https://trec.nist.gov), [MediaEval 2025](https://multimediaeval.github.io), and [NTCIR 19](https://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/ntcir-19).

#### Membership

ARC operates as a project group within the broader Data Science @ Georgia Tech student organization.
Members are expected to be members of DS@GT and adhere to its general guidelines.

- **Eligibility:** Open to all Georgia Tech students (undergraduate, graduate - including OMSCS/OMSA, PhD), and alumni with student status (e.g., enrolled in a for-credit seminar). Both on-campus and online students participate actively.
- **Requirements:** Members must be part of the parent DS@GT organization (including paying dues). Active participation, especially in the Fall, is crucial for Spring team placement.
- **Minimum Technical Expectations:** Proficiency in Python (SciPy stack: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) and Git version control. Familiarity with ML concepts is highly beneficial. Prior ML/IR project experience (non-trivial complexity) or software engineering experience is expected. Completion or enrollment in a project-heavy course (e.g., ML, DL) is recommended.

#### Group Structure and Schedule

Recordings of our Fall 2024 Interest Group can be found below and provide an overview of the group's structure and expectations.

</div>

The group operates on a two-semester academic cycle.

- **Fall Semester: Interest Group & Preparation**
  - **Focus:** Introduction to competitive data science (Kaggle) and research competitions (CLEF).
  - **Activities:** Weekly meetings, EDA assignments, paper discussions, internal Kaggle competition, foundational skills training (e.g., PACE usage).
  - **Outcome:** Formation of motivated and prepared teams for the Spring semester.
  - **Time Commitment:** ~2-3 hours/week (equivalent to a 1-unit seminar).
- **Spring Semester: Competition Execution & Publication**
  - **Focus:** Deep dive into specific CLEF tasks within dedicated teams.
  - **Activities:** Team-based research and development, model building, experimentation, result submission, writing and submitting working notes papers.
  - **Outcome:** Competition submissions, published papers, presentation of work.
  - **Time Commitment:** ~100-150+ hours total (equivalent to a 2-3 unit course), varies by role and project intensity.

#### Team Structure

- **Size:** Typically 3-5 members per team (including the lead). No more than 5 people on a single task due to complexity of sharding work.
- **Composition:** Aim for a mix of skills and experience levels where possible, fostering inclusivity and knowledge sharing (e.g., pairing experienced members with newer ones).
- **Roles:**
  - **Task Lead:** Responsible for managing a task team in the Spring. Duties include registering the team, defining the technical approach/plan, conducting weekly meetings, delegating tasks, tracking progress, reporting updates, leading paper writing/submission, and confirming team members. Requires significant time commitment and technical/project management skills.
  - **Task Member:** Responsible for actively contributing (coding, analysis, experiments), attending weekly meetings, reporting progress, contributing to the paper, and potentially presenting updates. Expected to have relevant technical skills (Python, Git, ML/data analysis basics) and commit sufficient time.
- **Goal:** One team per competition task, with no overlap in tasks between teams.
