# Fall Semester Interest Group

[Interest Group Sign up Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfODo9AxoE0exzTFT2115nYWbYw4dWfDK3jvnDvKoKH-3LkbA/viewform?usp=dialog)

Are you interested in doing research but need help knowing where to start? 
Are you interested in sinkng your teeth into applicable, real-world datasets to solve challenging problems? 
Join the Data Science at Georgia Tech (DS@GT) club as we tackle information retrieval and machine learning competitions at [CLEF 2026](https://clef2026.clef-initiative.eu/) in the Spring for our fifth year. 
The DS@GT competition team has won $10,000 worth of prizes across four working note competitions, and have over 30 accepted working note papers into workshop proceedings. 
For CLEF 2025 alone, we had 43 published authors! 
By joining us, you'll gain valuable experience, build a network of like-minded individuals, and have the opportunity to participate in competitive research. You can read more about our achievements on our [Impact](/impact) page. 

The interest group takes place in the fall semester and our goal is to learn about data science and research competitions and strategies for success. 
It will culminate in forming competition teams for CLEF 2026, a conference that systematically evaluates information access systems primarily through experimentation on shared tasks. 
All DS@GT members are welcome, regardless of your level of experience. 

## Suggested Prerequisites

- You should have prior programming experience. 
- You should be comfortable writing code in Python using the SciPy stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib). 
- No prior competition experience is necessary.

## Interest Group Format

The group will have one section that meet weekly in the evening during US Pacific Time (PST). 
Exact time is TBD.
Meetings are 1 hour in length and will vary in content. 
All meetings will be held and recorded on Zoom. 
The rough general schedule for the group is as follows:

**August** - Recruitment and Kickoff

**September** - Intro to Applied Research

**October** - Applied Research Continued

**November** - Cloud Computing Basics on PACE and Team Formation

Members can read, present, and discuss research, and write an exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
Expected time commitment for the Fall is 2-3 hours a week, with 1 hour for meetings and 1-2 hours preparing for the next week. 
Participation in the interest group will weigh heavily into Spring competition team placement. 
Participation in the interest group and returning members who published with us before will be prioritized for team placement. 
This has worked well for us in the past and we have not encountered an issue where there are more interested people than the amount of teams available. 
If more help is needed, we will also have a separate interview process at the end of the semester for broader recruitment.

I hope you find this exciting and attend our first meeting and kickoff when the Fall semester starts! 
At the first meeting, we'll introduce the club, discuss our goals and activities, and answer any questions you may have. 
Please [RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfODo9AxoE0exzTFT2115nYWbYw4dWfDK3jvnDvKoKH-3LkbA/viewform?usp=dialog) and weâ€™ll remind you when dates are solidified at the end of the first week.
