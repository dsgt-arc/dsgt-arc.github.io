# FAQ

## 1. What is CLEF?
**CLEF** [(Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum)](https://www.clef-initiative.eu/) is an annual independent peer-reviewed conference that focuses on advancing research in information access systems, particularly in multilingual and multimodal contexts.

CLEF aims to maintain and expand upon its tradition of community-based evaluation and discussion on evaluation issues in information retrieval. 
It provides an infrastructure for testing, tuning, and evaluating information access systems, creating reusable test collections, and exploring new evaluation methodologies.

Overall, CLEF strives to advance the state-of-the-art in information access technologies through its combination of academic conferences and practical evaluation labs.

## 2. What lab/task should I pursue?
Each lab and task addresses a problem in a particular domain. 
Are you more interested in natural language processing? 
Computer vision? Biodiversity conservation? 
Medical applications? Multi-modality? 
You may find a summary of each lab in the last question of this FAQ.
Review the task overview papers on the CLEF working notes page: [CEUR-WS.org/Vol-3740 - Working Notes of CLEF 2024](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3740/).

## 3. How many tasks can I participate in?
There is no limit to tasks that someone can participate in. 
We strongly recommend first-time members not doing more than one task.

## 4. What's the difference between a _team lead_ and a _team member_?
A **Lab Lead** is the main person responsible for delivering the task, including:
- Entering and participating in the competition/task
- Interviewing potential participants to join the team
- Conducting and hosting weekly team meetings
- Communicating team progress with team members and the DS@GT CLEF monthly meetings
- Delegating work within the team
- Submitting the working note paper for peer review and publication

A **Lab member** is responsible for the following:
- Making a real contribution to the competition/task
- Attending weekly meetings and reporting progress
- Attending and presenting at DS@GT CLEF monthly group meetings
- Writing portions of the working note paper related to the work done

Team leads and members are expected to commit time, have strong programming skills, and be legitimately curious about the lab and task.

## 5. How do I become a team lead for a task?
Apply in the form DS@GT CLEF 2026 Competition Signup (Form TBD) and specify your desired role (team lead or team member). 
If you apply to be a team lead, reach out to Anthony Miyaguchi (acmiyaguchi at gatech.edu) or Murilo Gustineli (murilogustineli at gatech.edu) with an overview of your proposed solution for the particular task.

## 6. What is the time commitment required to participate?
The time commitment varies depending on your role and the effort you want to put in. 
However, to make a meaningful contribution, you should expect to dedicate around 100–150 hours throughout the project. 
Think of it as the equivalent of a 2–3 unit course, requiring consistent effort. 
Team leads require additional time to manage their tasks and coordinate with team members. 
This is the type of experience where you get out what you put in.
Ultimately, your level of involvement is up to you, but consistent effort is key to gaining valuable experience and making an impact.

## 7. Can two teams participate in the same task?
No. A person can be part of one or more teams. 
But a team can only do one task.

## 8. Why can’t I edit the meeting documents?
You must join the **CLEF 2026 Google Group** (TBD) to be able to edit the meeting documents.  
This functionality will be granted to you *after joining*.

## 9. Is this opportunity only available for current students, or can alumni participate as well?
This opportunity is not limited to current students—GT alumni are also welcome to join our group! 
However, participants must be members of the Data Science @ Georgia Tech (DS@GT) club and have paid their membership dues. 
To join:
- Join the DS@GT Slack channel through [@datasciencegt | Linktree](https://linktr.ee/datasciencegt) 
- Join the channel `applied-research-competitions` in the DS@GT Slack
- Pay the membership dues: $25 for one year or $15 for one semester
- Payment links can be found at the bottom of the Linktree page

## 10. How can I earn academic credit for participating in CLEF?
If you are an OMSCS student, there are two primary ways to earn academic credit through CLEF participation: 
1. CS 8903 - Specieal Problems
2. CS 8803 O24 - Intro to Research

### CS 8903 – Special Problems
This is a supervised research course that requires special permission to enroll. To take this course, you need to:
- Develop a research proposal statement. Here’s an example of a research statement from a previous semester
[Spring 2024 - Statement of Research, Murilo Gustineli](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mh05O9RE9AF3MI9gyZz5aZzS08YlG2hc7mxopPquDfg/edit?usp=sharing)
- Secure a faculty member from the College of Computing (CoC) who agrees to supervise your research.
Finding a professor can be challenging due to limited availability, and enrollment is contingent upon obtaining their permission. 
You can find more information on the [Graduate Forms & Procedures | College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/graduate-forms-procedures)


### CS 8803 O24 – Intro to Research
This course offers a general introduction to research methods and computer science research. 
Unlike CS 8903, you can register for this course as part of your regular course selection in the OMSCS program.

## 11. What are the labs available at CLEF 2025?
Below is a short overview of the labs under the CLEF 2024 conference. 
You may find more information on each lab by reviewing their respective overview papers on the CLEF working notes page: [CEUR-WS.org/Vol-3740 - Working Notes of CLEF 2024](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3740/)

### QuantumCLEF
QuantumCLEF provides an evaluation infrastructure for developing Quantum Computing algorithms, particularly Quantum Annealing algorithms, for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems.
### SimpleText Lab
The SimpleText Lab seeks to make scientific knowledge more accessible by developing and evaluating AI models that simplify complex scientific texts, reduce misinformation risks, and improve public understanding through tasks on text simplification, hallucination control, and adaptive scientific content analysis.
### TalentCLEF
TalentCLEF is an evaluation lab that aims to establish a public benchmark and collaborative forum for assessing NLP models in Human Capital Management, promoting fairness, multilingual capability, and cross-industry adaptability to advance skill and job intelligence technologies.
### Touché
