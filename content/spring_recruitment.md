# Spring CLEF 2026 Competition

- **Sign up here:** [CLEF 2026 Competition Sign up Form](https://go.dsgt-arc.org/clef2026-form)

Are you interested in doing research but need help knowing where to start? 
Are you interested in sinking your teeth into applicable, real-world datasets to solve challenging problems? 
**Join the [Data Science at Georgia Tech (DS@GT)](https://datasciencegt.org/) club as we tackle information retrieval and machine learning competitions at [CLEF 2026](https://clef2026.clef-initiative.eu/) in the Spring for our fifth year!**
The DS@GT competition team has won $10,000 worth of prizes across four working note competitions, and have over 30 accepted working note papers into workshop proceedings.
For CLEF 2025 alone, we had 43 published authors! 
By joining us, you'll gain valuable experience, build a network of like-minded individuals, and have the opportunity to participate in competitive research. 
You can read more about our achievements on our [Impact](/impact) page. 

The CLEF 2026 competition begins in March and ends in May, with working note papers submitted by the end of May. 
To participate with the DS@GT-ARC CLEF 2026 team, you should meet at least one of the following criterias: 
- Returning members of DS@GT ARC who had published working note(s) with us
- Participated in the **[2025 Fall Interest Group](https://dsgt-arc.org/fall_recruitment/)**
- Experienced students (please see the self-assessment section below)

We are offering a CS8903 Special Problems course for the first time where you may enroll and earn academic credit for participating in CLEF! 
All participants of the course must submit a research proposal for the CLEF task they are interested in. 
Because this will be the first cohort, seats will be limited, and completing this form does not guarantee enrollment.
If you're an Alumnus and would like to join our research group in the spring, you will be required to register for CS 8903 (or any other course) for PACE access.

## DS@GT ARC - CLEF Competition Schedule

Monthly general meetings to share ideas and share progress between labs.
Each lab will have biweekly meetings (exact meeting frequency and meeting times will be coordinated by each lab lead).
The rough general schedule for the spring semester is as follows: 

**Late November to December** - Begin Lab team and Task teams formation

**January** - Finalize Lab and Task teams formation and Kickoff, Task Review, Research Planning and Literature Reviews

**February** - Preliminary Experiments

**March** - Datasets Released, Research Begins

**April** - Research Continues

**May** Final Submissions for the Competition

**End of May** - Working Note Papers 1st Submission

**June** - Working Notes Feedback and Final Paper Submission

## Self-Assessment
These questions capture the big idea that many of our teams will be exploring:
1. Dataset: Using the 20 newsgroups dataset, create a subset of 4 groups of 25 examples each.
2. What is transfer learning? What is unsupervised learning? What is an embedding space? Demonstrate the usage of Huggingface transformers to embed each post in the newsgroup dataset.
3. When would you use the cosine distance over the Euclidean distance when measuring distance in an embedding space? Write an assertion demonstrating the triangle inequality with embedding vectors.
4. What is a k-NN graph? Demonstrate the construction of a 3-NN graph using a ball tree using an edge list representation. How many edges are in the graph? What is the maximum number of edges in the graph?
5. What is Precision@k? What is NCDG? Why would you use one over the other? Find the five nearest neighbors of an item in the set as an ordered list. Compute scores between two random lists in the set. Compute the score between lists in the same group. Compute the score between lists in two different groups.
6. What is learning to rank? Create a dataset composed of items and their neighborhood lists. Demonstrate learning to rank on the dataset with XGBoost.

Try thinking through each question and task, and self-assess your ability to solve this problem. 
Consider solving this problem in a notebook and timing yourself, given access to the library documentation.

## Experiences
It would be helpful if you have practical software experience, at a bare minimum:
- You know how to use git and what most of these subcommands roughly do: `clone`, `fetch`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `stash`, `merge`, `log`, and `rebase`.
- You have used the scientific Python stack (e.g., imported `numpy` and `pandas`) and know how to use virtual environments.
It would also be helpful if you've had any of the following experiences:
- You have scripting experience with bash or Python and have changed file permissions via the command line.
- You have used a Docker container, have written a Dockerfile, and know how to write a Docker Compose specification.
- You have used pre-trained Torch or Tensorflow models for a domain-specific task.
- You have built a data/model pipeline. You have experience with Airflow or Luigi. You know about DAGs and idempotency as they relate to pipelines.
- You know how to project, filter, rank, and join relational data. You have used Spark, Hadoop, or Postgres. You can convert a dataset between CSV and Parquet.
- You have created or managed resources in a cloud provider like AWS or GCP or [PACE](https://pace.gatech.edu/). You have experience with Terraform and/or Ansible.
